# Quick Start Guide

Using Padel Counter is easy! On the main screen you just hit the `Play` button to start
configuring the settings of the match.

If you want to customize your experience before starting a match, you can go to the
`Settings` section by clicking the `Settings` button. More details on the available Settings
[here](./settings/index.md).

After hitting the `Play` button you will be redirected to the `Match Settings`. In this screen
you can configure the rule set for the match you're about to play. You can check more details of
each setting in the [Match Settings](./counter/match.md) page.

Once you have your rule set configured, you will go to the `Team Select` screen, where you have
to choose the teams that will play in the match. By default there are 2 predefined teams in case
you don't want to spend time inputting the team data for both teams. More details about
adding/removing/editing teams in the [Team Select](./counter/teams.md) page.

Clicking the `Start` button will take you to the **Padel Counter**.

![Counter](./assets/counter.png "Counter"){: style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:60%;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;"}

Once you're in here, you can double tap the side of the screen corresponding to each team to
increment their score. If you're using a remote controller and you remapped some keys/buttons
to the increment score actions of each team, by double clicking/pressing that input you'll also
increment the score.

If you make a mistake you can click the menu at the bottom right corner and click `UNDO` to undo your last scoring. More details on the options within this menu on the [Counter Details](./counter/counter.md) page.

The match will continue until one team wins. Alternatively you can exit the match by clicking
on the menu, scrolling left and clicking on the `Leave` button.

![Leave](./assets/leave.png "Leave"){: style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:60%;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;"}

And that's it! You know the basics of controlling Padel Counter.
