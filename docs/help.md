# Help / Report an issue

## Getting help

The app just recently launched so I don't have any Discord server nor a community where you can ask questions to other
users, you can contact me at the following email.

```
contact [at] rabid [dot] es
```

I can't put my email as-is because of bots crawling the web, but I hope you will manage to write me an email with the information above.

## Reporting an issue

I've opened [a Github Repository](https://github.com/rabid-dev/padel-counter-issue-tracker/issues) where you can report bugs or anything else.
You can report them in english or spanish, though I'd prefer english only to keep all the info in the same language.

I'll try to also document future enhancements just in case anyone is interested in the next steps of the development.
