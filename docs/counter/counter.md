# Counter Screen

This is the main screen of Padel Counter, where the score is kept.

![Counter](../assets/counter.png "Counter"){: style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:60%;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;"}

Double tapping the screen on each side will increment the score for each team.

If you have mapped a controller in the Controls section of the settings, you can also double press that input to increment the score.

In the bottom right corner there's a menu button you can press to show the following options:

![Counter Menu](../assets/countermenu.png "Counter Menu"){: style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:80%;padding-top:10px;padding-bottom:10px;"}
